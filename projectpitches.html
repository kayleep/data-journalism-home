<h3>Project Pitches</h3>

<p>It was no real surprise when Canada's Men's Hockey Team took home gold at the Sochi Olympics, the sport is after all Canada's pastime. But despite Canada's affinity for the sport, no Canadian NHL franchise has managed to take home the coveted Stanley Cup in nearly 20 seasons. This drought demands the question, why can't Canada win the cup?</p> 


<p>All three of my project pitches stem from trying to answer this question.</p>

<h3>The Franchise Cities</h3>

<p>I want to take a thorough look at the locations of NHL franchises in an attempt to find out why franchises are where they are, why they work, and why they don't. I'd like to look at this historically, as well as with some insight and speculation into future franchises.</p> 

<p>This subject has recently been one of great debate in the news, especially after the talk this past summer about the Pheonix Coyotes' relocation, when speculation surfaced about locations for future franchises. Therefore this project could be published soon. But because there's a historical component to this project, I don't think there's an expiration date on when it could run.</p>

<p>This project could find a home on any number of sports-related sites including thescore, Hockey News, SBnation, and more local Canadian sites like the National Post, Toronto Sun, Vancouver Sun, etc.</p>


<p>I will pull data from <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/"> hockeyreference.com</a> and check it against other hockey fact sites.</p> 

<p>In a perfect world I would talk to representatives from the NHL to comment on this topic, but I would settle for people in the sports media world, like hockey reporters in Toronto.</p>

<p>To complete this project I will need to acquire advanced skills to create a data visualization, starting by finding out exactly what skills/programs I need to know to do the project, and then getting those skills. I suspect this visualization will involve a map, so I will have to work on my mapping skills. It would probably involve acquiring some D3 skills. </p>

<h3>Canadians in the NHL</h3>

<p>I'd like to create a visualization of the birthplaces of NHL hockey players and tracking the location of the teams those players played for. Ultimately I'd like this visualization to shed light on why Canadian NHL franchises have performed so poorly in the last 20 years. To achieve this type of analysis my visualization will include data from 1917 to today.</p>  

<p>I'm hoping to find out if a)more Canadian hockey players have fled south of the border, and if b) there is a correlation between this and Canadian teams' poor performance. I'm hoping the data will point me to an analysis of Canada's lack of recent Stanley Cup wins.</p>

<p>This subject has been looked at before. But it hasn't been visualized fully, or at least not to my satisfaction. With Canada's gold win just behind us, and the count down to the Stanley Cup Playoffs just around the corner, this piece could be published soon. But because there's a historical component to this project, I don't think there's an expiration date on when it could run.</p> 

<p>This project could find a home on any number of sports-related sites including thescore, Hockey News, SBnation, and more local Canadian sites like the National Post, Toronto Sun, Vancouver Sun, etc.</p>

<p>I will pull data from <a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/"> hockeyreference.com</a> and <a href="http://hockeyanalytics.com /"> hockeyanalytics.com</a>.</p> 

<p>Once I gain insights from the data gathered, I think it could be helpful to get some more qualitative views on this topic, and talk to media people in the Canadian hockey world, like hockey reporters.</p>

<p>To complete this project I will need acquire advanced skills to create a data visualization, starting by finding out exactly what skills/programs I need to know to do the project, and then getting those skills. I suspect this visualization will involve a map, so I will have to work on my mapping skills. I'll also have to improve my data scrapping skills, because I don't want to have to manually download hundreds of data sets.</p>

<h3>Stanley vs. Money</h3>

<p>It has <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/why-cant-canada-win-the-stanley-cup/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0/">been said</a> that the financial success of Canadian NHL franchises has no bearing on their success on the ice, while American franchises must see wins to see financial gains. I'd like to examine this assertion in greater detail with a data visualization that begins in 1917, and assesses the correlation between finances and wins over time. </p>

<p>I think it might be helpful to talk to somebody at the NHL, but I know that's a long shot. So I could settle to talk to some people who deal alot with hockey in Canada, like sports reporters and other people in the media, to get some more qualitative pespectives on the issue. Since the Toronto Maple Leafs are the most valuable franchise, I might try to find someone close to the Leafs.</>
